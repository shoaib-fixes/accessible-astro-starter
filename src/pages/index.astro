            <p>
              Employ Wizard uses advanced AI algorithms to analyse CVs comprehensively. Our system goes beyond simple
              keyword matching to understand context, identify skill levels, assess experience relevance, and evaluate
              candidate potential. The AI considers factors like career progression, skill gaps, and job fit to
              provide detailed insights that help HR professionals make informed decisions.

          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Is Employ Wizard GDPR compliant?">
            <p>
              Yes, Employ Wizard is fully compliant with UK GDPR regulations. All data processing occurs within the
              United Kingdom, and we maintain comprehensive audit trails. We use end-to-end encryption, implement strict
              data retention policies, and provide transparency reports. Organizations can confidently use our platform

          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How does the AI ensure unbiased hiring?">
            <p>
              Our AI is trained on diverse datasets and includes multiple bias detection mechanisms. We regularly audit
              our algorithms for potential biases and implement fairness constraints. The system focuses on objective
              criteria like skills, experience, and qualifications rather than demographic information. Additionally,
              we provide transparency into how decisions are made, allowing HR teams to review and override AI
              recommendations when necessary.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What file formats does Employ Wizard support?">
            <p>
              Employ Wizard supports multiple CV formats including PDF, Microsoft Word (.docx), plain text, and HTML.
              Our intelligent parsing system can extract relevant information from various document structures and
              formats. The platform also handles different CV layouts and can process both formatted and unformatted
              documents effectively, ensuring comprehensive candidate analysis regardless of document type.

          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How secure is candidate data on your platform?">
            <p>
              Security is our top priority. We use industry-standard encryption (AES-256) for all data in transit and at
              rest. Our platform is hosted in secure UK data centres with ISO 27001 certification. We implement role-based
              access controls, regular security audits, and maintain detailed activity logs. Data is automatically
              deleted according to retention policies, and we never share candidate information without explicit consent.
